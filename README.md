#  Causal Discovery
Our approach uses three causal discovery algorithms (PC, SIMY, and GES) to infer the causal graphs of the datasets. This is the first step of the aproach as we use the results of this esperiments in our research questions. To infer the causal graphs of a given datasets we used R programing language and pcalg package. The file [Causal_discovery.R](https://github.com/armanunix/Fairness_Practices_Robustness_Testing/blob/main/Causal_Discovery.R) implements infering the causal graphs from dataset.
