#  Causal Discovery

Our approach employs three causal discovery algorithms—PC, SIMY, and GES—to infer the causal graphs of the datasets. This represents the first step of our methodology, as the outputs of these experiments are subsequently used to address our research questions. We implemented the causal discovery process in R using the pcalg package, as detailed in the [Causal_discovery.R](https://github.com/armanunix/Fairness_Practices_Robustness_Testing/blob/main/Causal_Discovery.R) script. This script infers the causal graphs for the Bank dataset using all three algorithms. To apply the procedure to other datasets, the corresponding dataset path must be uncommented in the code (e.g., for the Adult dataset, uncomment the line data_path <- './subjects/datasets/adult_org-Copy1.csv'). The output is a CSV file representing the Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG) for each dataset. The script stores the CPDAGs in the directory ./{Dataset}_Analysis/{DiscoveryAlgorithm}/DAGs/ using the naming format {Dataset}_{DiscoveryAlgorithm}.csv. For instance, the CPDAG for the Bank dataset using the PC algorithm is saved as ./Bank_Analysis/pc/DAGs/Bank_pc.csv. Note that the resulting CPDAG may still contain some bidirectional edges due to equivalence class ambiguity.
